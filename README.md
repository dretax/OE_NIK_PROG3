# OE_NIK_PROG3
Ã“buda University, Java-C# mixup project.

This was the half-year project for the Webprogramming and Modern Programming subject.
It includes the Java, and C# solution by me, and the documentation which I was kinda lazy to enchance, but It's there.

This project is only uploaded here to show future students hints about the task.
The project cannot be used as an "own solution". Do NOT upload this as If It was yours!

## Disclaimer
I received some news from the teachers that most students tend to copy paste this project, and not using It for hints or more like a reference project. Coding is not about copy pasting, and this repository is now marked. If you build up your project from this one completely you may expect a failure at the end of the semester.

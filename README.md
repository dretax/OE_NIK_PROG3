# OE_NIK_PROG3
Óbuda University, Java-C# mixup project.

This was the half-year project for the Webprogramming and Modern Programming subject.
It includes the Java, and C# solution by me, and the documentation which I was kinda lazy to enchance, but It's there.

This project is only uploaded here to show future students hints about the task.
The project cannot be used as an "own solution". Do NOT upload this as If It was yours!

\subsubsection*{N\+Unit 3.\+10.\+1 -\/ March 12, 2018}

Added a namespace to the props file included in the Nu\+Get package to make it compatible with versions of Visual Studio prior to VS 2017.

\subsubsection*{N\+Unit 3.\+10 -\/ March 12, 2018}

This release adds a .N\+ET Standard 2.\+0 version of the framework which re-\/enables most of the features that have been missing in our earlier .N\+ET Standard builds like parallelism, timeouts, directory and path based asserts, etc. It also contains numerous bug fixes and smaller enhancements. We\textquotesingle{}ve improved our X\+ML docs, fixed performance issues and added more detail to Multiple Asserts.

This release also contains source-\/indexed P\+DB files allowing developers to debug into the N\+Unit Framework. This allows you to track down errors or see how the framework works.

In order to support the .N\+ET Standard 2.\+0 version, the N\+Unit project switched to the new C\+S\+P\+R\+OJ format and now requires Visual Studio 2017 to compile. This only effects people contributing to the project. N\+Unit still supports building and compiling your tests in older .N\+ET I\+D\+Es and N\+Unit still supports older versions of the .N\+ET Framework back to 2.\+0. For contributors, N\+Unit can now compile all supported targets on Windows, Linux and Mac using the Cake command line build.

\subsubsection*{N\+Unit 3.\+8.\+1 -\/ August 28, 2017}

This release fixes two critical regressions in the 3.\+8 release. The first caused the console runner to crash if you are using test parameters. The second issue caused collection constraints checking for multiple items in a collection to fail.

\subsubsection*{N\+Unit 3.\+8 -\/ August 27, 2017}

This release removes several methods and attributes that were marked obsolete in the original 3.\+0 release. Support for i\+OS and Android has been improved.

An issue that caused unit tests to run slower was addressed as was a bug that prevented the use of Assert.\+Multiple in async code.

\subsubsection*{N\+Unit 3.\+7.\+1 -\/ June 6, 2017}

\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{N\+Unit 3.\+7 -\/ May 29, 2017}

This release of N\+Unit expands on parallel test execution to allow test methods to be run in parallel. Please see the \href{https://github.com/nunit/docs/wiki/Parallelizable-Attribute}{\tt Parallelizable Attribute} for more information.

N\+Unit 3.\+7 also drops the Portable build of the framework and replaces it with a .N\+ET Standard 1.\+3 version to compliment the .N\+ET Standard 1.\+6 version. This change enables several constraints and other features in the .N\+ET Standard builds that weren\textquotesingle{}t available in portable like Path and Directory based asserts.

The Assertion\+Helper class has been deprecated because it is seldom used and has not received any of the updates that Asserts and Constraints receive. If your code is using the Assertion\+Helper class, we recommend that you migrate your asserts.

\subsubsection*{N\+Unit 3.\+5 -\/ October 3, 2016}

This is the first version of N\+Unit where the framework will be released separately from the console runner, engine and other extensions. From this point forward, the N\+Unit Framework will be released on its own schedule that is not bound to that of any other N\+Unit project and version numbers may diverge over time.

This is also the first release where the N\+Unit Framework will not be included in the installer. Only the console runner, engine and extensions will be available as an M\+SI installer. We recommend that you use the N\+Unit Nu\+Get packages for the framework, but a Z\+IP file with the binaries will also be available.

\subsubsection*{N\+Unit 3.\+0.\+0 Beta 5 -\/ October 16, 2015}

\paragraph*{Framework}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Parameterized test cases now support nullable arguments.
\item The N\+Unit framework may now be built for the .N\+ET Core framework. Note that this is only available through building the source code. A binary will be available in the next release.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\paragraph*{Engine}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The engine now runs multiple test assemblies in parallel by default
\item The output X\+ML now includes more information about the test run, including the text of the command used, any engine settings and the filter used to select tests.
\item Extensions may now specify data in an identifying attribute, for use by the engine in deciding whether to load that extension.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\paragraph*{Console Runner}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The console now displays all settings used by the engine to run tests as well as the filter used to select tests.
\item The console runner accepts a new option --maxagents. If multiple assemblies are run in separate processes, this value may be used to limit the number that are executed simultaneously in parallel.
\item The console runner no longer accepts the --include and --exclude options. Instead, the new --where option provides a more general way to express which tests will be executed, such as --where \char`\"{}cat==\+Fast \&\& Priority==\+High\char`\"{}. See the docs for details of the syntax.
\item The new --debug option causes N\+Unit to break in the debugger immediately before tests are run. This simplifies debugging, especially when the test is run in a separate process.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\item Removed the dependency on Microsoft.\+Bcl.\+Async from the N\+Unit Framework assembly targeting .N\+ET 4.\+0. If you want to write async tests in .N\+ET 4.\+0, you will need to reference the Nu\+Get package yourself.
\item Added a new Test\+Fixture\+Source attribute which is the equivalent to Test\+Case\+Source but provides for instantiation of fixtures.
\item Significant improvements have been made in how N\+Unit deduces the type arguments of generic methods based on the arguments provided.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\paragraph*{Engine}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item If the target framework is not specified, test assemblies that are compiled to target .N\+ET 4.\+5 will no longer run in .N\+ET 4.\+0 compatibility mode
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{N\+Unit 3.\+0.\+0 Beta 2 -\/ May 12, 2015}

\paragraph*{Framework}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The Compact Framework version of the framework is now packaged separately and will be distributed as a Z\+IP file and as a Nu\+Get package.

\paragraph*{General}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item There is now a master windows installer for the framework, engine and console runner.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\paragraph*{Framework}


\begin{DoxyItemize}

Third-\/party runners may override the selection process by including a copy of the engine in their installation directory and specifying that it must be used.
\item The V2 framework driver now uses the event listener and test listener passed to it by the runner. This corrects several outstanding issues caused by events not being received and allows selecting V2 tests to be run from the command-\/line, in the same way that V3 tests are selected.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\paragraph*{Console}


\begin{DoxyItemize}

\paragraph*{Breaking Changes}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item N\+Unit\+Lite tests must reference both the nunit.\+framework and nunitlite assemblies.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\paragraph*{Framework}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The N\+Unit and N\+Unit\+Lite frameworks have now been merged. There is no longer any distinction between them in terms of features, although some features are not available on all platforms.
\item The release includes two new framework builds\+: compact framework 3.\+5 and portable. The portable library is compatible with .N\+ET 4.\+5, Silverlight 5.\+0, Windows 8, Windows Phone 8.\+1, Windows Phone Silverlight 8, Mono for Android and Mono\+Touch.
\item A number of previously unsupported features are available for the Compact Framework\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Generic methods as tests
\item Regex\+Constraint
\item Timeout\+Attribute
\item File\+Assert, Directory\+Assert and file-\/related constraints
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}

\paragraph*{Engine}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The logic of runtime selection has now changed so that each assembly runs by default in a separate process using the runtime for which it was built.
\item On 64-\/bit systems, each test process is automatically created as 32-\/bit or 64-\/bit, depending on the platform specified for the test assembly.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\paragraph*{Console}
